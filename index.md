## Overview

Outdoor Buddies aims to help students find others interested in hiking, running, and walking around Oahu. The application will allow users to create profiles, discover compatible groups and activities, join outdoor events, and share information about local outdoor locations.

The goal is to make outdoor activities more accessible, social, and safer by helping students connect with others who share similar interests and preferences.

### The Problem

People love taking hikes, running, and walking in Hawaii. There are many areas and paths with beautiful scenery all around Oahu. Sometimes people don’t feel comfortable hiking, running or walking by themselves, and it can be hard to find a group of people with whom to go.

### The Solution

The Outdoor Buddies App will allow students to login, create a profile marking certain preferences, view pre-existing groups or create a new one, and join with other students on the many beautiful hiking, running, and walking spots on Oahu. They can message each other within the app, post announcements for group hiking events, and create a community.

## User Guide

This section provides a walkthrough of the Outdoor Buddies user interface and its capabilities.

### Landing Page

The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site. This allows users to see what the mission statement of the website is to determine if they would like to utilize its services.

#### Hikes

The Hikes page shows hikes that people like to do and recommend for newcomers to Hawaii. Users who are new to Hawaii a way to get more information on the different hikes that people can do on Oahu. This is to get a feel for if a certain hike is right for them. While it isn't shown, the search function does work and searches by name, location, and description of the trail. There are also options to filter by difficulty and distance (in miles).

![](images/hike-list-page.png) 

Users can click on the name of the hike in blue and that will take them to a page with a text-blurb that gives more expanded details about the hike. Users can view more information about a hike including what to bring, what to look out for and more.

## Community Feedback

We asked 5 members of the UH Community to try to test the Outside Buddies web application on both the user and the dev end. For each community member, we hav split their answer into the categories: 'Things that I liked', 'Things that could be improved'

### UH Community Member 1: (Civil Engineering Major, very little computer experience)

**Things that I liked:**

I liked the style of the website; I also think that the functions make sense for what the app is meant to do.

**Things that could be improved:**

A feature you could consider implementing in the future is a way to see nearby users based on location? That way if someone gets lost or separated from the group, hopefully someone would be able to find them or the person that got lost would be able to find their way back.

### UH Community Member 2: (Computer Science Major, took ICS 314 before)

**Things that I liked:**

I liked the colors and general theme of the website. I think it's interesting and unique.

**Things that could be improved:**

A feature that you could consider implementing in the future is allowing users to attach their different social medias (like Instagram, TikTok, Discord, etc.) to their Profile. That way, other users would have the option to communicate on different platforms, where it could be more convinient, especially if it's a large Group.

### UH Community Member 3: (Mathematics Major, took ICS 314 before)

**Things that I liked:**

I like the logo and the colors, it's quirky. It gives a early 2000s era of internet aesthetic. I also like that the auth has been set up and that typing the url pathways doesnt allow users to access forbidden pages. Overall, I like the concept, I think it's neat.

**Things that could be improved:**

A future feature could be having a search bar algorithm where the "likeliest" search will dropdown from the search bar based on what is the most likely successive letter. Also having back buttons would make the experience a lot better.


### UH Community Member 4: (Mathematics Major, some computer experience)

**Things that I liked:**

I really like the concept and colors. It's nice to have information about the Hikes as well to give people ideas, even if they don't set up a Group within the application. It's nice that if the image link is incorrect, you have a default profile picture and image file that loads up, so that you don't have to just look at a clear error with some text.

**Things that could be improved:**

It would be nice to be able to message different users just within the Profile like a private message.

### UH Community Member 5: (Mathematics Major, little computer experience)

**Things that I liked:**

I overall liked the concept. I think that the website looks really cool. I like that I was able to write a post. I thought that was nice. Also having a Hikes List for people who are new here is a great idea, especially since there are a lot of hikes on Oahu.

**Things that could be improved:**

There could be a discussion feature underneath each hike for users to communicate their tips and tricks. Implementing a map feature for the hikes could be nice too. A friends system would also be a nice touch, where you can friend other profiles.

## Development History

### Milestone 1: Mockup development

The goal of [Milestone 1](https://github.com/orgs/outdoor-buddies/projects/1) was to create mockups of each of the pages for our Outdoor Buddies Website. Specifically Announcements(/Events), Hikes, Groups, and Profiles.

### Milestone 2: Data model development

The goal of [Milestone 2](https://github.com/orgs/outdoor-buddies/projects/3) was to implement the data model: for Announcements(/Events), Hikes, and for Groups and Profiles (especially connecting them to a specific User) on the site. We also fixed certain login issues, transferring to the vercel deployment database, and added basic features, such as searching, adding, editing, and deleting functions. Users can add, edit, and delete Groups and Profiles. Admins can add, edit, and delete Announcements(/Events) and Hikes.

### Milestone 3: Final touches

The goal of [Milestone 3](https://github.com/orgs/outdoor-buddies/projects/4) is to clean up the code base, implement features that we were unable to complete in Milestone 2, have some users test our app while also implementing their suggestions, add more entries into our tables, adjust some of the styles, including fonts, colors etc. We added in a dynamic search that can filter based on certain components for both Hikes and Groups. Groups also now has a Forum Page where users can post asking a group some questions or to request to join.
