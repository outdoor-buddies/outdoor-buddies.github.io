## Overview

BowFolios is an example web application that provides pages to view and (in some cases) modify profiles, projects, and interests. It illustrates various technologies useful to ICS software engineering students, including:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

It also provides code that implements a variety of useful design concepts, including:

* Three primary collections (Profiles, Projects, Interests) as well as three "join" Collections (ProfilesInterests, ProfilesProjects, and ProjectsInterests) that implement many-to-many relationships between them.
* Top-level index pages (Profiles, Interests, and Projects) that show how to manipulate these six collections in various ways.
* Initialization code to define default Profiles, Interests, and Projects and relations between them.
* A simple Filter page to illustrate how to perform simple queries on the database and display the results.
* Use of Meteor Methods to illustrate how to simplify implementation of multiple collection updates.
* Use of indexes to enforce uniqueness of certain fields in the collections, enabling them to serve as primary keys.
* Authentication using the built-in Meteor accounts package along with Sign Up and Sign In pages.
* Authorization examples: certain pages are public (Profiles, Projects, Interests), while other pages require login (AddProject, Filter).
* Use of Meteor Assets to initialize the database (helpful when initialization exceeds settings file size limits).

## User Guide

This section provides a walkthrough of the Bowfolios user interface and its capabilities.

## Project Goals

Outdoor Buddies aims to help students find others interested in hiking, running, and walking around Oahu. The application will allow users to create profiles, discover compatible groups and activities, join outdoor events, and share information about local outdoor locations.

The goal is to make outdoor activities more accessible, social, and safer by helping students connect with others who share similar interests and preferences.

### Landing Page

The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site.

### Index pages (Projects, Profiles, Interests)

Bowfolios provides three public pages that present the contents of the database organized in various ways.

The Profiles page shows all the current defined profiles and their associated Projects and Interests:

The Projects page shows all the currently defined Projects and their associated Profiles and Interests:

Finally, the Interests page shows all the currently defined Interests, and their associated Profiles and Projects:

### Add Project page

Once you are logged in, you can define new projects with the Add Project page:

![](images/add-project-page.png)


### Filter page

The Filter page provides the ability to query the database and display the results in the page. In this case, the query displays all of the Profiles that match one or more of the specified Interest(s).

## Development History

### Milestone 1: Mockup development

The goal of Milestone 1 is to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system.

### Milestone 2: Data model development

The goal of Milestone 2 is to implement the data model: the underlying set of Mongo Collections and the operations upon them that would support the BowFolio application.

## Milestone 3: Final touches

The goal of Milestone 3 is to clean up the code base and fix minor UI issues.
