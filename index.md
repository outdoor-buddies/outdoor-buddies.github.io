## Overview

## User Guide

This section provides a walkthrough of the Bowfolios user interface and its capabilities.

## Project Goals

Outdoor Buddies aims to help students find others interested in hiking, running, and walking around Oahu. The application will allow users to create profiles, discover compatible groups and activities, join outdoor events, and share information about local outdoor locations.

The goal is to make outdoor activities more accessible, social, and safer by helping students connect with others who share similar interests and preferences.

### Landing Page

The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site.

The Profiles page shows all the current defined profiles and their associated Projects and Interests:

## Development History

### Milestone 1: Mockup development

The goal of Milestone 1 is to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system.

### Milestone 2: Data model development

The goal of Milestone 2 is to implement the data model: the underlying set of Mongo Collections and the operations upon them that would support the BowFolio application.

## Milestone 3: Final touches

The goal of Milestone 3 is to clean up the code base and fix minor UI issues.
